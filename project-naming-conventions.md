## Project Naming Conventions

For a project for example an application named "applicationA" we want to have different repositories for different parts of the project. The naming convention we use is as follows:

- `applicationA-api`: The API of the application
- `applicationA-web`: The frontend of the application for the web
- `applicationA-docs`: The documentation of the application, this repository it's going to contain all the information related to:
    - the business logic of the application
    - how to use it
    - why we created it
    - the architecture of the application
    - the design of the application
    - the ideas behind the creation of the application
- `applicationA-ops`: The operations of the application, in case we need to use something like terraform to deploy the application
- `applicationA-mobile`: The mobile app of the application.
